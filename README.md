# Modelling Safecracker 40

Modelling 'Safecracker 40' in VDM-SL, then translating the model into Isabelle (unfortunately the translation is not yet functional, but the groundwork is there).

From [Crux Puzzles](https://cruxpuzzles.co.uk/product/safecracker-40/):

_The Safecracker 40 is based on a design from 1911._

_The aim is to align all 16 columns so they each add up to 40 at the same time._ 

_There is a base layer with a further four rings on top which rotate. There are a lot of possible combinations for this to sit at but only one solution._
